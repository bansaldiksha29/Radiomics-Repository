# radiomics-matlab
matlab code for doing radiomic including handling of dicom, dicom-rt, boxing around the ROI, feature extraction, etc

Code is mainly written by Paul Desbordes

The code is still a big mess, path are not portable between windows and linux, but its matlab so why bother making good code anyway..
